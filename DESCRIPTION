Description: Provides an interface and a C++ implementation of the RecMap MP2
  construction heuristic (see 'citation("recmap")' for details). This algorithm
  draws maps according to a given statistical value (e.g., election results,
  population or epidemiological data). The basic idea of the RecMap algorithm is
  that each map region (e.g., different countries) is represented by a
  rectangle. The area of each rectangle represents the statistical value given
  as input (maintain zero cartographic error). Documentation about RecMap is
  provided by a vignette included in this package.
