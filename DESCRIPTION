Description: This package contains an implementation of the recmap algorithm.
  The input contains for each map region a x-y coordinate, a map ratio, and 
  a statistical value.
  The x-y coordinates representing the centers of gravity, the ratio the lat/long 
  ratio, and the  statistical values define the desired 
  area of each map region. 
  The output is a rectangular cartogram where the map regions are non
  overlapping, connected, ratio and area of each rectangle corresponde to the 
  desired areas.
  The construction heuristing places the map region by preserving important 
  geospatial constraints, in particular the topology of the pseudo dual,
  the relative position, and the ratios of each input map regions.
