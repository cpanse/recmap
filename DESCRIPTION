Description: Provides an interface and a C++ implementation 
  of the RecMap MP2 construction heuristic (see 'citation("recmap")' 
  for details). This algorithm draws maps according to a given statistical 
  value (e. g. election results, population or epidemiological data). 
  The basic idea of the RecMap algorithm is that each map region 
  (e. g. different countries) is represented by a rectangle. The area of 
  each rectangle represents the statistical value given as input. 
  Documentation about 'RecMap' is provided by a vignette included in this 
  package and a 'RecMap gallery' site at
