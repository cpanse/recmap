Description: Provides an interface and a C++ implementation of the RecMap MP2
  construction heuristic (Panse C. (2018) <doi:10.18637/jss.v086.c01>).
  This algorithm draws maps according to a given statistical value
  (e.g., election results, population or epidemiological data).
  The basic idea of the RecMap algorithm is that each map region
  (e.g., different countries) is represented by a rectangle.
  The area of each rectangle represents the statistical value given
  as input (maintain zero cartographic error). Documentation about the usage
  of the recmap algorithm is provided by a vignette included in this package.
