abstract="The quad tree is a data structure appropriate for storing information to be retrieved on composite keys. We discuss the specific case of two-dimensional retrieval, although the structure is easily generalised to arbitrary dimensions. Algorithms are given both for staightforward insertion and for a type of balanced insertion into quad trees. Empirical analyses show that the average time for insertion is logarithmic with the tree size. An algorithm for retrieval within regions is presented along with data from empirical studies which imply that searching is reasonably efficient. We define an optimized tree and present an algorithm to accomplish optimization in n log n time. Searching is guaranteed to be fast in optimized trees. Remaining problems include those of deletion from quad trees and merging of quad trees, which seem to be inherently difficult operations.",

abstract="Today, a variety of heuristic approaches are available to the operations research practitioner. One methodology that has a strong intuitive appeal, a prominent empirical track record, and is trivial to efficiently implement on parallel processors is GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures). GRASP is an iterative randomized sampling technique in which each iteration provides a solution to the problem at hand. The incumbent solution over all GRASP iterations is kept as the final result. There are two phases within each GRASP iteration: the first intelligently constructs an initial solution via an adaptive randomized greedy function; the second applies a local search procedure to the constructed solution in hope of finding an improvement. In this paper, we define the various components comprising a GRASP and demonstrate, step by step, how to develop such heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems. Intuitive justifications for the observed empirical behavior of the methodology are discussed. The paper concludes with a brief literature review of GRASP implementations and mentions two industrial applications.",

Because for each such scale it is possible to construct infinitely many transformations, this paper investigates restrictions under which such cartograms are possible. It is shown that it is possible to construct transformations that preserve the location of boundaries and of any finite number of predefined points. However, these cartograms are often quite distorted. Different types of distortions and suitable measures are discussed.}
